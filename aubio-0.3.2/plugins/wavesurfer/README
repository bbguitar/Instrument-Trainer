This directory contains a plugin file and a configuration file for wavesurfer.
It's actually just a label widget with some added functions. Install them in

	~/.wavesurfer/1.6/{plugins,configurations} 
    or	/usr/lib/wsurf1.6/{plugins,configurations}

and they should appear next time you launch wavesurfer.

The config box to set different options is still to be written.
