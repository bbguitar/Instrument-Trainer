This directory contains 2 patches for audacity and a nyquist plugin.

The patch audacity-nyquist.diff is made from the current nyquist release
source. It's here to activate s-save function which seem to have been left out
of the audacity source tree.

The other patch is a modification i made to nyx so that the 'system' command
works and an addition to xlisp to have the 'ftoa' and 'atof' functions.

The nyquist plugin aubioonset simply saves the current selection to a file and
calls the aubioonset program on this file. The text file obtained is then read,
converted to a list of labels and unlinked.

Starting a patched audacity from the directory above plug-ins should add an
entry 'Onset detection...' to the Process menu.
